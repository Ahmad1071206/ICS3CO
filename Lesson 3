# Using print is far more flexible. It uses 
# a format specifier %d to tell it to place an integer 
# there, but you also have to indicate the actual variable
# after your quote: 
# %d is a format specifier for type int print ("There are %d people in this room." % 28)
# %d is a format specifier for type double print
