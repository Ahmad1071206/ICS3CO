count = 9
while (count != 0):

    count -= 1
# This code starts with count = 9, and enters a while loop that prints the value of count until count is no longer not equal to 0. The code decreases `count` by 1 in each iteration, and prints the result.


count = 9
while (count != 0):
    count -= 1
    print(count)
# This new code will now decrease count first and then print the new value.
